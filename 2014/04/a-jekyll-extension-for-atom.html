<div class="bg-white prose border-gray-300 border shadow-xl p-2"><p>I recently got into the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> beta and have been using it for the past couple of weeks with no problems at all. One of the big features of <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> is that it is hackable to the point that it comes by default with a make new package command.</p>

<p>The only package I really use at the moment is <a href="https://atom.io/packages/Zen">Zen</a> which is super simple, if you look at the source all it does it attach a couple of extra classes and supply a stylesheet.</p>

<p>Most of my work at the moment has been focused around <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> so it was as good a place as any to start thinking about a package. I quickly wrote <a href="https://github.com/Arcath/jekyll-new-post">jekyll-new-post</a> and threw it out into the wild but pretty much as soon as I fixed issue #1 I started thinking of other things I could get <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom</a> to do for me and it quickly became apparent that jekyll-new-post was to focused a name.</p>

<h2 id="jekyll-atom"><a href="https://atom.io/packages/jekyll">Jekyll-Atom</a></h2>

<p>Instead of creating hundreds of Jekyll themed packages I decided to bundle everything into one, this way if you are using Jekyll you just install this 1 package and get all the functionality instead of picking and choosing.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-it-do">What can it do?</h3>

<p>First off it provides a bunch of snippets for HTML/GFM/MD e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jv</code> expands to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{{ ... }}</code>. A full list of the snippets appears in the settings when you install the package.</p>

<p>It then currently has 3 commands that can be triggered a multitude of ways. One to open the layout for the current document, so this post has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layout:post</code> in its front matter if I press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cmd+Alt+L</code> Atom will open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts/post.html</code> for me. Secondly it adds a command to the pallet to open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> not the most ground breaking feature but its nice to have. Lastly it provides the same box as jekyll-new-post making that plugin redundant, anyone using it will need to disable it before using <a href="https://atom.io/packages/jekyll">Jekyll-Atom</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m using this new plugin here with no issue but if you find one you can open an <a href="https://github.com/Arcath/jekyll-atom/issues">issue on the github repo</a> and I will look at it.</p>

<p>I have a couple of ideas for expanding it but I need to look more at how <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom</a> works behind the scenes and whether I can link into things like autocomplete.</p>
