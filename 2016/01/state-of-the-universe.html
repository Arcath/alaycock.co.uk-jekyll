<div class="bg-white prose border-gray-300 border shadow-xl p-2"><p>This site has just had a pretty major <a href="https://github.com/Arcath/arcath.github.io/commit/de18e7adc43dce79ee6572fd23af624d95328ab1">re-design</a> which I am intending to be the start of me writing a lot more here.</p>

<h2 id="more-writing">More writing</h2>

<p>I do loads of cool things in my day job that deserve to be shared, if only to save some other poor soul the time of discovering the source of the fault.</p>

<p>I do have quite a few articles that never got published for one reason or another which needs to stop.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p>I have a few projects that are actively used by the community which I have regrettably neglected over the past few months and that needs to change. I have a few ideas for improvements that also need to be brought into the world.</p>

<h3 id="adauth">ADAuth</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Arcath/adauth">ADAuth</a> I’m sorry to say is dead to me, along with the ruby language in general. I haven’t worked in ruby for over a year now (aside from the odd dips into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails c</code>) and to work on ADAuth again would require a fair bit of re-learning which due to it being a security/authentication gem isn’t safe in my opinion.</p>

<p>We only use it in one Rails App now which is in the process of being re-written for Node.</p>

<p>I am happy to pass on any knowledge I can about how it works to anyone looking to replace it.</p>

<h3 id="express-permissions">Express-Permissions</h3>

<p>I’m not sure about this project, I lost my need for it short term but I may pick it back up soon.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-atom">Jekyll-Atom</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Arcath/jekyll-atom">Jekyll-Atom</a> is one of my more popular packages and it needs some love and attention.</p>

<p>In no particular order my ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove Layouts/Posts/Includes/Data/Sites Dir options and get it from _config.yml instead.</li>
  <li>Move Posts Type into _config.yml.</li>
  <li>Remove Layouts Type and just open any file type.</li>
  <li>Make Build Command the default build command and let users set the build command in _config.yml.</li>
  <li>Allow users to set a default front matter in _config.yml that applies to new posts.</li>
  <li>FINISH DRAFTS.</li>
  <li>Try and improve the build speed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motorway">Motorway</h3>

<p>Motorway is working well and is improving the way my projects <em>look</em> and <em>feel</em>.</p>

<h3 id="sodb">sodb</h3>

<p>I’m pretty happy with where <a href="https://github.com/Arcath/sodb">sodb</a> is, it works really well and is pretty fast. Its development tends to be fueled by what I need it to do in other projects.</p>

<h2 id="interesting-things--work">Interesting things @ Work</h2>

<p>I’m doing a lot at the moment with Windows 10 as I suspect most IT Engineers are which is shaping most of my work.</p>

<p>I have a long list of Domain Rebuilds to do at the moment which again is giving me plenty of time for experimentation so there should be some posts coming from that.</p>
