<div class="bg-white prose border-gray-300 border shadow-xl p-2"><p>This is part 9 of my Screeps story, you can read the whole story <a href="/tag/screeps">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="gcl3">GCL3</h2>

<p>I’ve hit GCL 3 and its time to take on a third room. I want a room with 2 sources and there is only one near me. <a href="https://screeps.com/a/#!/room/W24N68">W24N68</a>. Its placement near another player is not ideal but I can live with it.</p>

<p>After claiming it the other player set creeps to attack it. I expected this and they went straight to my construction sites. A hostile creep need only touch a construction site to destroy it.</p>

<p>I was getting nowhere fast. The other player was destroying my spawn before I could build it, and ever after I build it there is no guarantee that they won’t come and wipe it out straight away. That’s when I had an idea. I altered the constructor code so that they would rush level 2 on the controller (it takes 200 energy,  1 constructor can do it in one sitting). This gave me a safe mode which I activated straight away.</p>

<p>Progress was good, having 2 sources and the support of my main room this room was flying along until the safe mode ran out. I was hoping to hit RC3 before the safe mode ran out so I could get a tower up but that didn’t happen.</p>

<p>A single creep was all they needed to take out my spawn and then it was clean sailing to wipe the structures from the room.</p>

<p>To defend my room without a tower or walls I added a <em>defendRoom</em> directive to my code. My AI will now keep 2 defenders alive in the given room at all times. I await the next attack.</p>

<p>This plan worked against the single creeps. I needed to rebuild the spawn a couple of times but I was pushing on to RC3 hoping that another safe mode would solve my problems.</p>

<p>The other player decided to step up their attacks and hit all of my rooms hard. I did login midway through and wanted to try and rebuild but with Christmas there was no time to look at it.</p>

<h2 id="respawning">Respawning</h2>

<p>I respawned and left my code to it checking in to place some buildings.</p>

<p>This highlighted an issue with my AI, it can’t do new rooms. The number of construction sites for the roads was getting in the way and slowing things down. Once I got to RC3 things had stabilised and my room began to steamroller its way up.</p>

<p><img src="./new-room.png" alt="New Room" /></p>

<p>My new room has a 2 source room right next to it. My AI is pretty good at getting new rooms off the ground using the energy from a stable neighbour.</p>

<p>Everything is going quite well with nothing new to report code wise.</p>

<p>Part 9 is quite short as the respawn has set me back quite a bit. I hope to get a bit more aggressive shortly.</p>

<h2 id="get-screeps">Get Screeps</h2>

<p>You can follow my progress on <a href="https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Arcath">my profile</a>. Once I reach RC4 I’m not sure how I am going to progress yet.</p>

<p>You can read more about Screeps on their <a href="https://screeps.com/">site</a>. I purchased it through steam giving me the permanent 10 CPU and the desktop client.</p>
