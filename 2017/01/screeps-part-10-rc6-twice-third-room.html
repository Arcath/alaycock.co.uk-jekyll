<h2 id="rc6-twice">RC6 Twice</h2>

<p>After the respawn in the <a href="/2017/01/gcl3-another-respawn/">last post</a>, my rooms have been plodding along nicely. I now have 2 rooms at RC6. This means 2 rooms extracting and selling minerals.</p>

<p>My AI doesn’t make full use of labs yet so instead of leaving minerals alone I extract and sell as much as I can. This is leading to a pretty healthy credits balance which I will be putting to use in the future.</p>

<p>Having 2 high-level rooms is great. My economy is performing pretty well and when I add a third room to the mix it should be lifted to a self-sustaining level quickly.</p>

<h2 id="mining-another-room">Mining another room</h2>

<p>Way back in <a href="/2016/11/screeps-part-2-rc3/">part 2</a> I made some creeps to mine from other rooms I didn’t own. It wasn’t hard with my new AI to re-implement them.</p>

<p>The workflow is something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Am I full?
    <ul>
      <li>Yes:
        <ul>
          <li>Am I in the drop off room?
            <ul>
              <li>Yes: Run normal hauler code</li>
              <li>No: Move to drop off room</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>No:
        <ul>
          <li>Am I in the harvest room?
            <ul>
              <li>Yes: Run normal harvester code</li>
              <li>No: Move to harvest room</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My AI has all the code I need to do this already.</p>

<p>My creep director checks for a few things in a creeps memory before it runs the normal functions. In this case, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goToRoom</code> memory entry is used to specify a room to go to. If this key exists the director runs a separate function instead of the usual function for that creeps action. Once it is in the room it needs to be in <em>normal</em> operations resume and the creep performs its intended job.</p>

<h2 id="attack">Attack!</h2>

<p>It’s time to give my AI some teeth.</p>

<p>It’s time to stop being passive and instead take what I need.</p>

<p><a href="https://screeps.com/a/#!/room/E63S74">E63S74</a></p>

<p>A 2 source room held by a player who’s AI seems very basic.</p>

<p>The only barrier for me is their tower. It can destroy one of my creeps before I can reach it. So I need to feed infantry into it until it runs out of energy.</p>

<p>Half of the battle in screeps is observing the way the other players AI is working. My opponents AI has some exploitable flaws.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It tries to pick up any dropped energy.
    <ul>
      <li>When my creeps die to the tower they send creeps to pick up the energy.</li>
      <li>This puts his creeps in striking distance of mine.</li>
      <li>Killing all his creeps means no resupply of that tower.</li>
      <li>All his creeps come to the energy. This is the problem I solved in part 7.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If their creeps stray too close to the room exit they pass into mine and make no attempt to flee.
    <ul>
      <li>My 2 towers destroy them very quickly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>They are at RC5 but only have 5 extensions.
    <ul>
      <li>Their creeps are underpowered, it’s like attacking someone at RC2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After sending 2 creeps to their death I had caused a pretty big disruption to their room. They are down to 2 surviving creeps which is affecting their supply situation. No deliveries to spawn or the tower will be a great help to my war effort.</p>

<p>You can follow my progress on <a href="https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Arcath">my profile</a>. Once I reach RC4 I’m not sure how I am going to progress yet.</p>

<p>You can read more about Screeps on their <a href="https://screeps.com/">site</a>. I purchased it through steam giving me the permanent 10 CPU and the desktop client.</p>

<p>You can see my code as it was at the end of this post <a href="https://github.com/Arcath/screeps-code/tree/569b694ebaf313439c244ffa6bf09e6a3217e081">here</a>.</p>
