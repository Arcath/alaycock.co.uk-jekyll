<h2 id="w48n98">W48N98</h2>

<p>My new room is pretty run of the mill but it does have a fair few rooms around it that can be mined or claimed. As I said at the end of the last post I don’t intend on rushing up to my room limit favouring remote mining to get my creeps up.</p>

<p>Firstly I need to get this room up and running properly. It is in a free safe mode for now and I need it to get to RCL3 with a tower before that runs out otherwise it has no chance of surviving an attack. The previous owner has left some very nice walls around which I will keep for now.</p>

<p>The journey to RCL3 was painful. Watching my harvesters scramble to build extensions, upgrade the controller, and keep spawn and the extensions full of energy highlighted exactly why I use specialised creeps for each job. I built one of the source containers and a general use container to speed up upgrading.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017/07/screeps-part-15-new-empire/cmd.png" alt="Running a Command" /></p>

<p>I had a typo in my code that unfortunately meant that around 3 am one morning my AI stopped working. Completely. The error was in job list creation which meant that the creeps actor was not getting run.</p>

<p>It did give me a chance to test my emergency spawning code. When a room has 0 creeps, well 0 harvesters, my AI will spawn the best harvester it can afford instead of a full cost one. It will then spawn a hauler if needed under the same rules. If you have less than 300 energy in spawn &amp; extensions you will get 1 energy per tick until you reach 300. This means that it should be possible to recover any room as long as you have a spawn.</p>

<p>It took around an hour to get back to full capacity and resume the slow trudge to RCL3. I’m out of safe mode at this point so it is a little risky. An attacker could end my journey right now.</p>

<p>I built a second general use container for my upgraders so they could resupply without moving. Once I hit RC4 I will replace the original with a storage.</p>

<h2 id="rcl3">RCL3</h2>

<p>RCL3 is special. It’s the level where towers come into play and my room can settle into its functions properly. It’s when I have enough spawn energy to claim and harvest other rooms.</p>

<p>As soon as I get to RCL3 I build the tower. Once it’s up and doing all my repairing for me I start building the second source container and the 5 new extensions.</p>

<p>Once all that was built It was time to look at other rooms. I claimed W48N96 and began building a spawn. I sent reservers into W48N99 followed by a remote miner. I updated the code for revenue calculation to include the cost of the reservation creeps.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017/07/screeps-part-15-new-empire/revenue.png" alt="My remote mining revenue" /></p>

<p>The revenue is pretty poor at the moment. Once I reach RC4 the remote mining creeps should be faster and actually turn a profit. The creep has a long walk to containers which won’t be helping. Once I reach RCL5 it can drop off into a link by the exit which will make it even faster.</p>

<h2 id="rcl4-and-3-more-rooms">RCL4 and 3 more rooms</h2>

<p>RCL4 didn’t have the impact on remote mining that I wanted. The creeps simply have too far to walk to make it cost effective. I added a system to spawn a hauler with a work part that could move energy from a remote container to the room doing the mining whilst repairing the roads etc… and it works pretty well. I now just about break even on the mining. RCL5 is where my hopes lie now, links should remove enough walking to turn a profit.</p>

<p>With RC4 I have the energy to spend on claimers and support creeps to get other rooms off the ground. I have mentioned before that a claiming a new room does not give you a free spawn. You have to construct one taking 15K energy. This is where my green flags come in. A green flag tells the nearest room to send a creep to harvest a source and build the construction site. I normally only use them to get the spawn built but they can be used for anything.</p>

<p>My Grafana is showing me 2-3 days on all my timers (next RCL and GCL) which is great but does mean there’s not much I can do at the moment. The missing parts of my code are the high-level stuff like the market, boosting, and warfare.</p>

<p>Once I reach the higher levels I will be working on all that and hopefully build an empire that can hold its own in a war.</p>

<p>You can follow my progress on <a href="https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Arcath">my profile</a>. Once I reach RC4 I’m not sure how I am going to progress yet.</p>

<p>You can read more about Screeps on their <a href="https://screeps.com/">site</a>. I purchased it through steam giving me the permanent 10 CPU and the desktop client.</p>

<p>You can see my code as it was at the end of this post <a href="https://github.com/Arcath/screeps-code/tree/ef92fd6a94111e9e8322ceb117c779c013d47e48">here</a>.</p>
