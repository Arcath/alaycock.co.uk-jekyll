<div class="bg-white prose border-gray-300 border shadow-xl p-2"><p>I’ve redesigned my site! If you followed me back when I used Jekyll this was a regular occurance and something that using a static site generator makes so easy.</p>

<p>There has been a trend of late of adding a <em>dark mode</em> to sites. From what I can see there are 2 main reasons for this. The darker page is kinder on the eyes when viewed in a low-light environment and with the growing number of users who desktops are running in dark mode all the time it reduces the contrast they experiance.</p>

<p>Quite a few sites are adding functionality to switch between light and dark mode (for example <a href="https://smakosh.com/how-to-add-dark-mode-easily-with-a-custom-react-hook">with react hooks</a>) which I could have used here but for now at least I’m leading with dark mode.</p>

<p>My decision to drop <em>light mode</em> came around for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is no way to tell if the user is using dark mode on their device (<a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=prefers-color-scheme">yet</a>). This means I have to default to either light or dark and let the user switch, I can see a scenario where a dark mode user would be blinded by light mode before swapping whilst I can’t think of a negative for light mode users who load up in dark mode.</li>
  <li>Maintaining two colour schemes means maintaining two colour schemes. I’d have a harder job testing content against both colour schemes and with accessibility in mide I’d rather put my focus into a single <em>theme</em>.</li>
  <li>I’d like users to have a consistent experiance. If I’m making content I’d like all my users to see it at its best and invariably there will be content that looks better in one mode.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following the example of resir014’s <a href="https://resir014.xyz/design/">design page</a> I’ve put all the elements of the site onto a single page for testing and showing off. You can see this page <a href="/elements">here</a> and I will be updating it as I add more features.</p>

<p>I have ideas on how to exampnd this site which I hope to get going soon and I welcome any feedback you have on the new layout.</p>
