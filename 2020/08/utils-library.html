<div class="bg-white prose border-gray-300 border shadow-xl p-2"><p>If you <a href="https://github.com/Arcath">follow me on GitHub</a> you may have seen that one of the repositories that I commit to on a semi regular basis is <a href="https://github.com/Arcath/utils">Arcath/utils</a>. This isn’t the only thing I work on but it is the only bit of at-work code that enters the public domain.</p>

<p>Now you might be thinking <em>why do we need yet another utils library?</em> and you’d be right, we don’t need another utils library but I wrote one to practice and craft functions that work better for me.</p>

<p>I don’t expect or have any designs on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@arcath/utils</code> becoming an always installed package for anyone other than myself. If it saves anyone time then great I’m glad I shared it but that was never the aim.</p>

<p>I started my own uitls library for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I needed some more esoteric functions that where too small for their own package but I still needed them in multiple codebases. (e.g. <a href="https://utils.arcath.net/globals.html#rangeasstring">rangeAsString</a>)</li>
  <li>I needed to type some functions better. (e.g. <a href="https://utils.arcath.net/globals.html#mapproperty">mapProperty</a>)</li>
  <li>I wanted to test functions more thoroughly than I could if it was within a bigger project.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s been quite nice writing functions in a self contained format and focusing on small tasks. The feedback loop on getting them working is really quick and I’m really happy with the way they work.</p>

<p>I’ll admit that some of them got used once and never again, the need for some have even been refactored out of the app I wrote them for but again the practice from writing them was good and I have them if I ever need them again I have them.</p>

<p>They are fully documented through TypeDoc at https://utils.arcath.net if anyone wants to use them.</p>

<p>I would reccomend that everyone build a utils library you don’t have to release it publically but it is something I’ve found very helpful. I’ve enjoyed doing all the testing, documenting and design without any pressure.</p>
