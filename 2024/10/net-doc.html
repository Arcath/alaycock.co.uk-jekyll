<div class="bg-white prose border-gray-300 border shadow-xl p-2"><p>For the past 8 months I’ve been working on a documentation system for us to store everything we might need on our network. Especially given that <em>“network”</em> in a secondary school means everything from the Hyper-V cluster down to the access control units for the motorised gates at the front of school.</p>

<p>Documentation is a really important part of the network. I had little to none when I started at my current school and even with my best efforts I found that when our new engineer started I just didn’t have the documentation needed to get them up to speed without me to answer lots of questions. So it came time to make a proper system and spend the time writing everything down.</p>

<p>I first started this project thinking I’d find it required more time than I could give it, but I’m almost surprised to say that today I released version 1.0.0, which represents the first stable release! There is still work to do and plenty of <em>issues</em> placed against the version 1.1 milestone but right now it’s working for us and getting better with every commit.</p>

<p>We had tried a few systems before I decided to try building my own. Originally we used a shared OneNote notebook, which has the same flaw to me as a wiki, a lot of copying the same content around so we can make all the “VLAN” documentation look the same. Some of the systems I looked at seemed to either tie you into their structure, or where a wiki in a different skin.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-net-doc">What is Net-Doc?</h2>

<p>So what is Net-Doc? Net-Doc is a documentation system that allows you to build out the structure of your documentation your way. It gives very little out of the gate which allows 2 instances to vastly different. We for example have our “main” network documentation in one container and then another one which is the Duke of Edinbrugh kit list.</p>

<p>Data is split into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Assets</code>, which are a collection of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fields</code>. An <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Entry</code> is an instance of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Asset</code> which stores <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Values</code> for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fields</code>. Some of the SQL queries are monsters, finding values only for entries that you have permission to read causes an interesting build up of conditions.</p>

<p>There is then a “simple” markdown <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document</code> store, which can feed into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">process</code> list.</p>

<p>Finally there is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Password</code> system that stores passwords and user account details using reversible encryption. The keys for which are set in environment variables.</p>

<p>All of these display their relationships and revisions, for example from our core switch entry.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2024/10/net-doc/entry-links.png" alt="Entry Links" /></p>

<p>It has a link to the <em>Backups</em> VLAN, as it is mentioned in the notes field for that VLAN. The link to the <em>Server Room</em> network cab comes from a relation on the cabinet that lists all the switches in the cab. We then have a link to the password for the switch.</p>

<p>There is then the revision history for the entry. From here we can go back to any point in the past for the entry.</p>

<p>Our asset list has become quite big:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2024/10/net-doc/asset-list.png" alt="Asset List" /></p>

<p>We’ve found it invaluable being able to build the assets as we need. We’ve even found that we’ve been replacing some fields with whole assets, getting ready to add sub-assets as a future feature.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-net-doc">How is Net-Doc?</h2>

<p>Net-Doc is built using <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a> and <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a> which have both been amazing to work with. The database backend is an <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database which really suits this use-case.</p>

<p>There is quite a few packages included in Net-Doc that can all be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Longridge-High-School/net-doc/blob/main/package.json">package.json</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What Next?</h2>

<p>We aren’t done with Net-Doc, not by a long way. But today’s release gets us a stable base to build from, and ultimately if we stopped development today it would function no problem for anyone taking over the network.</p>

<p>All the enchancement ideas are listed on the GitHub issue tracker, so you can keep track of how was are going.</p>
