I built a new domain for a school on new hardware. This new domain is linked to Azure AD for user synchronisation and auto sign in. OneDrive is synced and configured automatically for all staff.

This domain is the product of a lot of consultation with the school to ensure that the staff and pupils are getting the most they can out of the computers.

Staff where kept informed through out the whole process ensuring that access to systems and documents where not interrupted and everyone knew where to find resources after the work was completed.

Following the work Staff have given great feedback on how well the whole school IT is working now.
