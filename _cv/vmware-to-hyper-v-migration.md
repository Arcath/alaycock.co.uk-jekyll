title: Migrating VMWare to Hyper-V

I migrated all of our VMWare VMs over to HyperV, moving them onto a SAN and setting up Failover Clustering.

Due to the need to power off the VMs during the transfer this took a lot of co-ordination with staff to minimise the disruption caused.

Migrating to HyperV allowed us to leverage the existing skills of the team both with more HyperV experience and Windows management in general.
