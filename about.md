I am a School Network Manager from the North West of England.

I've spent the last 15 years working as an IT Engineer in Schools. I've worked with all kinds of technologies, everything from Interactive Displays & Hall Audio systems through to USB Microscopes.

As an Engineer at Ed-IT Solutions, I've built Windows domains from scratch and designed school internet connections. I run a cluster of VPS Web servers and provide web hosting to schools.

I'm a component NodeJS and PHP developer that has worked on websites and web applications ranging from small shop Gatsby sites to school WordPress sites and data management apps.
