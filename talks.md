Through the [ANME](https://anme.co.uk/) I have given talks at the North West meetings.

## Chrome OS within a Microsoft estate

Early 2024 I gave a talk at the North West ANME meeting on how we had intergrated ChromeOS Flex into our Microsfot Estate. Essentially how we had used Google without using Google.

## Building Confidence through effective monitoring

Mid 2023 I gave a talk at the North West ANME meeting on how our school setup [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) to monitor everything on the network.
